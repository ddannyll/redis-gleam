# Redis in GleamLang

I was bored over the holidays and decided to try build REDIS using **Gleam!!**

My first time using a _functional_ language to this extent.

Was a bit tricky working without mutability, if statments and loops... but I got used to it eventually :)

This challenge was taken from [Code Crafters](https://app.codecrafters.io/)
